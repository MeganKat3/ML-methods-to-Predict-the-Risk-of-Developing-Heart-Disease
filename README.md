**ABSTRACT**
This study aimed to develop a predictive model to determine whether an individual has heart disease or not based on personal key indicators. The machine learning methods used to determine these outcomes include decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. Based on the study, all three machine learning methods show high accuracy in detecting whether or not a person has heart disease based on personal key factors.
**INTRODUCTION**
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death among people of all races in the United States. According to Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease, approximately 47% of Americans have at least one main risk factor for heart disease: high blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and physical activity ( Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease, n.d.). The primary question that this study seeks to answer is whether or not an individual has heart disease based on personal key indicators provided in the data set. This research project focuses on specific machine learning methods such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The methods, results, data description and discussion sections will be addressed and will go deeper into explaining the outcome of this primary research question.
